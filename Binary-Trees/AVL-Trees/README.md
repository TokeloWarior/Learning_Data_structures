# AVL Tree

An **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree that maintains a height balance factor of -1, 0, or +1 for every node.  

This section explores:
- Rotation operations (LL, RR, LR, RL)  
- Maintaining balance after insertion and deletion  
- Height calculation and balance factor tracking  

**Goal:**  
To learn how automatic rebalancing keeps search operations consistently efficient at **O(log n)**.
