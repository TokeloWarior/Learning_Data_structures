# Heap

A **Heap** is a specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property:  
- **Max-Heap:** Parent ≥ children  
- **Min-Heap:** Parent ≤ children  

Covered topics:
- Insertion and deletion (heapify up/down)  
- Array-based heap representation  
- Priority queue implementation  

**Goal:**  
To understand how heaps efficiently support priority-based access and are used in algorithms like **Heapsort** and **Dijkstra’s**.
