# Data Structures from Scratch 🚀

This repository is my personal journey to **master the implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms** — from the ground up, using clean and well-documented Python code.

The goal is not just to make things *work*, but to truly understand **how** and **why** each structure behaves the way it does — exploring internal logic, recursion, memory management, and performance trade-offs.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The aim of this repository is to:

- Strengthen my **foundational understanding** of data structures and algorithmic thinking.
- Practice implementing each structure **from first principles**, without relying on built-in libraries.
- Prepare for **technical interviews** and **real-world software engineering problems**.
- Build a consistent, reference-quality collection of DSA implementations that I can expand and optimize over time.

---

## 🧩 Learning Scope

The repository will cover the **most important data structures** that every computer scientist and software engineer should be able to implement and explain.

Each topic will include:
- A conceptual breakdown of how the structure works internally.
- Its **operations** (insert, delete, search, traversal, etc.).
- Time and space complexity analysis.
- Recursive vs. iterative implementation perspectives.
- Notes on **when and why** to use it in real-world systems.

## 🌳 Current Focus: Trees

### Binary Search Trees (BST)
Starting point of the journey — learning:
- Node structure and properties  
- Recursive insertion and search  
- Traversal types (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- Understanding how the **call stack** drives recursion  
- Visualizing how tree shape affects lookup efficiency

Upcoming tree structures:
- **Binary Tree (generic)**
- **AVL Tree (self-balancing)**
- **Heap (Min / Max)**
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**

## 📚 Learning Roadmap

### 1. Linear Data Structures
Understand how data is stored and accessed sequentially:
- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists** (Singly and Doubly)
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Hash Tables**

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
Dive into hierarchical and connected data relationships:
- **Binary Trees**
- **Binary Search Trees**
- **AVL Trees**
- **Heaps**
- **Graphs** (Adjacency List / Matrix)
- **Tries**

### 3. Supporting Algorithms
Learn how to manipulate and navigate these structures efficiently:
- **Recursion and Backtracking**
- **Searching Algorithms** (Linear, Binary, BFS, DFS)
- **Sorting Algorithms** (Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- **Graph Algorithms** (Dijkstra’s, Topological Sort)
- **Dynamic Programming Basics**

## 🧠 What to Expect

Each implementation will:
- Be written **from scratch** in Python and java 
- Include **inline documentation** and detailed explanations  
- Emphasize **clarity before optimization**  
- Focus on **conceptual understanding** — not memorization  
- Evolve over time with improvements, comments, and test cases  

By the end of this series, I aim to:
- Be able to design and implement **any data structure** confidently.  
- Understand **time complexity trade-offs** between structures.  
- Use data structures effectively when solving **real-world problems** or **system design challenges**.
