# Red-Black Tree

A **Red-Black Tree** is a self-balancing BST that enforces specific color and structure rules to maintain near-perfect balance.  

Key learning areas:
- Node coloring (red or black)  
- Rotation and recoloring logic  
- Balancing after insertion and deletion  

**Goal:**  
To explore how color-based balancing ensures O(log n) search performance without excessive rotations, as used in many standard libraries.
