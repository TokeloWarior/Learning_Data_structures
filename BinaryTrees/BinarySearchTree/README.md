# Binary Search Tree (BST)

A **Binary Search Tree** is a binary tree where each node’s left child contains a smaller value and the right child contains a larger one.  

This section focuses on:
- Node creation and insertion  
- Recursive and iterative search  
- Tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order)  
- Deletion operations and edge cases  

**Goal:**  
To understand how data ordering improves lookup speed and how recursion naturally fits BST logic.
