# Trie (Prefix Tree)

A **Trie** is a tree-like structure used to store strings efficiently by sharing common prefixes.  

Topics include:
- Node structure and character mapping  
- Insertion and search for words and prefixes  
- Applications in autocomplete and spell-checking  

**Goal:**  
To understand prefix-based data storage and retrieval for string-heavy problems.
